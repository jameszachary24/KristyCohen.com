Subject: Task Complete: Mobile Menu Fix

I have completed the "Mobile Menu Fix" task.

Changes:
- Refactored `MobileMenu.jsx` to use theme variables (`bg-primary`, `text-secondary`, `bg-secondary/10` active states) instead of hardcoded Slate/Purple values.
- Increased touch target size for the Close button (padding p-2 -> p-3).
- Smoothed out the slide-in animation (changed from `spring` to `tween` easeInOut).
- Verified the build locally.
